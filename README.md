## Description

The purpose of this project is to update my online portfolio of work to share with potential employers.

### Motivation

A portfolio of work is used to showcase skills and talents to employers who are looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as our thought processes behind it. Having several live, deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies, so it is very important to build an online portfolio.

### Why I Built This

With this in mind, I added screenshots with live links to connect to my live projects on GitHub or Heroku, wherever they might be deployed. I also included a link to my updated resume.

This web application is **accessible** to users who will view it both on larger computer screens and also on smaller screen sizes, and the code is **up to current industry standards** and **uses best known practices**.

**Accessibility** is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. **Accessible** sites also rank higher in search engines and ensure that **all** users can easily access the information provided.

### The Problem I am Solving

Before I created this online portfolio, I had no way to show potential employers my skills and live work samples. This online portfolio allows me to:

1. Link to my resume
2. Showcase my live, working public projects
3. Showcase my HTML and CSS skills
4. Tell potential employers a bit about myself
5. Link to my LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social accounts
6. Show that I understand and implement accessibility and responsive design.
